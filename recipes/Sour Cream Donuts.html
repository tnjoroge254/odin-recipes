    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sour cream makes these old-fashioned donuts stay moist and taste amazing! I like to coat the donuts completely with the sweet glaze while they are still warm so they soak it up and get that shiny glazed look you see at your favorite donut shop!</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups bleached cake flour (such as Swans Down®), plus more as needed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅔ cup sour cream, room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks, room temperature</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>vegetable oil as needed for frying</li>
        <li>4 ½ cups powdered sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons hot water</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons light corn syrup</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Whisk sour cream, granulated sugar, egg yolks, melted butter, oil, and vanilla together in a large bowl until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually fold flour mixture into sour cream mixture just until combined. (Dough will be quite soft and sticky.)</li>
        <li>Cover, and chill in the refrigerator until dough is cold and just slightly firmed, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a heavily-floured surface and pat or roll to 3/8- to 1/2-inch thickness, flouring hands or rolling pin as needed. Cut dough using a floured 3 ½-inch round cutter. Cut holes in the center of the dough circles using a floured 1 ¼-inch round cutter. Transfer dough rings to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Reroll, and cut dough scraps, repeating process as needed.</li>
        <li>Heat 3 inches of oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat until a deep-fry thermometer registers 360 degrees F to 365 degrees F (182 degrees C to 185 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Fry 1 to 2 donuts at a time until golden brown and cooked through, about 1 to 1 ½ minutes per side, adjusting heat as necessary to maintain oil temperature.</li>
        <li>Transfer donuts to a baking sheet lined with paper towels using a spider strainer. Let drain, and cool for 5 minutes (see note).</li>
        <li>Whisk together powdered sugar, melted butter, hot water, corn syrup, salt, and vanilla in a large bowl for the glaze until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Place 1 warm donut in the powdered sugar mixture, craggy side up; use a spoon to coat donut completely in the glaze.</li>
        <li>Remove donut from glaze using two forks placed underneath; let excess drip off, and then transfer donut to a wire rack placed over a rimmed baking sheet. Repeat with remaining donuts and glaze.</li>
   <li>Let donuts stand until glaze is set before serving, about 25 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
